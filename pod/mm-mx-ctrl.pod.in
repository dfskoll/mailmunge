=head1 NAME

mm-mx-ctrl - Control mailmunge-multiplexor

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    mm-mx-ctrl [options] command

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<mm-mx-ctrl> is a command-line tool for communicating with
L<mailmunge-multiplexor>.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item -h

Displays usage information.

=item -s I<path>

Specifies the path to the C<mailmunge-multiplexor> socket.  If
not specified, defaults to @SPOOLDIR@/mailmunge-multiplexor.sock.

=item -i

This flag causes C<mm-mx-ctrl> to sit in a loop, reading commands
on standard input and printing results to standard output.  It is
intended for use by a monitoring program such as
L<watch-multiple-mailmunges>.

=item -b

This flag causes C<mm-mx-ctrl> to print a less-than sign on a line by itself
before its usual output, and a greater-than sign on a line by itself after
the usual output.  This lets programs that run C<mm-mx-ctrl -i> as a subprocess
know when the output from the most recent command has ended.

=head1 COMMANDS

The following commands are available:

=over

=item status

Prints the status of all worker Perl processes in human-readable format.

=item rawstatus

Prints the status of all worker Perl processes in a format easy to
parse by computer.  The result is a single line with six words on it.
The words are separated by a single space character.

Each character in the first word corresponds to a worker, and is "I"
for an idle worker, "B" for a busy worker, "S" for a worker which is not
running, and "K" for a worker which has been killed, but has not yet
exited.  A worker is "idle" if there is a running Perl process waiting
to do work.  "Busy" means the Perl process is currently filtering a
message.  "S" means there is no associated Perl process with the
worker, but one can be started if the load warrants.  Finally, "K"
means the worker Perl process has been killed, but has yet to
terminate.

The second word is the total number of messages processed since the
multiplexor started up.  The third word is the total number of workers
which have been activated since the multiplexor started up.  (That is,
it's a count of the number of times the multiplexor has forked and
exec'd the Perl filter.)

The fourth word is the size of the queue for request queuing, and the
fifth word is the actual number of requests in the queue.  The sixth
word is the number of seconds elapsed since the multiplexor was started.

=item barstatus

Prints the status of busy workers and queued requests in a nice
"bar chart" format.  This lets you keep an eye on things with a script
like this:

  while true ; do
      mm-mx-ctrl barstatus
      sleep 1
  done

=item histo

Prints a histogram showing the number of workers that were busy each time
a request was processed.  A single line is printed for the numbers
from 1 up to the maximum number of workers.  Each line contains the count
of busy workers (1, 2, 3 up to MX_MAXIMUM), a space, and the number of
times that many workers were busy when a request was processed.

=item load

Prints a table showing "load averages" for the last 10 seconds, 1 minute,
5 minutes and 10 minutes.

Each row in the table corresponds to a time interval, displayed in the
first column.  The remaining columns in the table are:

C<Msgs:> The number of messages scanned within the row's time interval.

C<Msgs/Sec:> The average number of messages scanned per second within
the row's time interval.

C<Avg Busy Workers:> The average number of busy workers whenever a
message was scanned.  (If you are processing any mail at all, this
number will be at least 1, because there is always 1 busy worker when a
message is scanned.)

If you have the C<watch> command on your system, you can keep
an eye on the load with this command:

  watch -n 10 mm-mx-ctrl load

If you do not have C<watch>, the following shell script is a less
fancy equivalent:

 #!/bin/sh
 while true; do
     clear
     date
     mm-mx-ctrl load
     sleep 10
 done

=item rawload

Prints the load averages in computer-readable format.  The format
consists of twenty-nine space-separated numbers:

The first four are integers representing the number of messages
scanned in the last 10 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes and 10 minutes.

The second four are floating-point numbers representing the average
number of busy workers in the last 10 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes and
10 minutes.

The third four are floating-point numbers representing the average
time per scan in milliseconds over the last 10 seconds, 1 minute, 5
minutes and 10 minutes.

The fourth four are the number of worker activations (new workers started)
over the last 10 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes and 10 minutes.

The fifth four are the number of workers reaped (workers that have exited)
over the last 10 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes and 10 minutes.

The sixth four are the number of busy, idle, stopped and killed workers.

The seventh four are the number of messages processed, the number of
worker activations, the size of the request queue, and the number of requests
actually on the queue.

The final number is the number of seconds since the multiplexor was started.

=item load-relayok

Similar to C<load>, but shows timings for C<filter_relay> calls.

=item load-senderok

Similar to C<load>, but shows timings for C<filter_sender> calls.

=item load-recipok

Similar to C<load>, but shows timings for C<filter_recipient> calls.

=item rawload-relayok

Similar to C<rawload>, but shows timings for C<filter_relay> calls.
Note that the worker activation and reap statistics are present, but always
0.  They are only valid in a C<rawload> command.

=item rawload-senderok

Similar to C<rawload>, but shows timings for C<filter_sender> calls.
Note that the worker activation and reap statistics are present, but always
0.  They are only valid in a C<rawload> command.

=item rawload-recipok

Similar to C<rawload>, but shows timings for C<filter_recipient> calls.
Note that the worker activation and reap statistics are present, but always
0.  They are only valid in a C<rawload> command.

=item load1 I<nsecs>

The C<load1> command displays the load for various commands over
the last I<nsecs> seconds, where I<nsecs> is an integer from
10 to 600.  The C<load1> command combines the output of
C<load>, C<load-relayok>, C<load-senderokf> and C<load-recipok>
into one display.

You might use the command like this:

  watch -n 10 mm-mx-ctrl load1 60

=item rawload1 I<nsecs>

Returns the C<load1> data in human-readable format.  The result is
a line containing twenty-six space-separated numbers:

The first three numbers are the number of scans performed in the last
I<nsecs> seconds, the average number of busy workers when a scan was
initiated and the average number of milliseconds per scan.

The second three are the same measurements for C<filter_relay> calls.

The third three are the same measurements for C<filter_sender> calls.

The fourth three are the same measurements for C<filter_relay> calls.

The thirteenth through sixteenth numbers are the number of busy, idle,
stopped and killed workers, respectively.

The seventeenth number is the number of scans since C<mailmunge-multiplexor>
was started.

The eighteenth number is the number of times a new worker has been activated
since program startup.

The nineteenth number is the size of the request queue and the twentieth
number is the actual number of queued requests.

The twenty-first number is the time since program startup and the twenty-second
number is a copy of I<nsecs> for convenience.

The twenty-third through twenty-sixth numbers are the number of workers
currently executing a scan, relayok, senderok and recipok command respectively.

=item workers

Displays a list of workers and their process IDs.  Each line of output
consists of a worker number, a status (I, B, K, or S), and for idle or
busy workers, the process-ID of the worker.  For busy workers, the line
may contain additional information about what the worker is doing.

=item busyworkers

Similar to C<workers>, but only outputs a line for each busy worker.

=item workerinfo I<n>

Displays information about worker number I<n>.

=item reread

Forces C<mailmunge-multiplexor> to kill all idle workers, and terminate
and restart busy workers when they become idle.  This forces a reread of
filter rules.

=item msgs

Prints the total number of messages scanned since the multiplexor started.

=back

=head1 ADDITIONAL COMMANDS

You can supply any other command and arguments to C<mm-mx-ctrl>.  It
percent-encodes each command-line argument, glues the encoded
arguments together with a single space between each, and sends the
result to the multiplexor as a command.  This allows you to send
arbitrary commands to your Perl workers.  See
L<Mailmunge::Filter/unknown_command> for additional details.

=head1 PERMISSIONS

C<mm-mx-ctrl> uses the multiplexor's socket; therefore, it probably
needs to be run as I<root> or the same user as C<mailmunge-multiplexor>.
